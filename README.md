Project was live at https://neigborapp-frontend.herokuapp.com/ but is in maintenance for now.

This was an old school project where the main purpose was to help heople find other people to do stuff.
It was using a Ruby backend, and since I'm not very familiar with Ruby anymore I may rewrite the backend with NodeJS if I feel like this project is going somewhere.
